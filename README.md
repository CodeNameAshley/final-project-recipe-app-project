# 💡 Project philosophy

> Hungry and unsure of what to eat? Are the ingredients in your fridge stopping
> you from deciding what to cook? Don't let hunger 🙍‍♂️ turn into anger 😡! Use
> 'foodle' 🙌 'foodle' lets you search for recipes based on the ingredients you
> have in your fridge! Simply type the ingredients in the search bar 🔍, scroll
> through the recipes 📜, click on a recipe for the instructions and start
> cooking 👩‍🍳! 'foodle', food made simple!

# 🟢 Steps

### `git clone https://github.com/CodeNameAshley/recipe-app-project`

- Clone the repository from our github page.

### `npm i`

- Run npm i to install all dependencies and dev dependencies from the
  package.json
- Obtain a free API key from Spoonacular. All you need is an email address to
  get the key!
- Create a .env in src folder and put
  `REACT_APP_API_KEY='enter your api key here'`

### `npm start`

- To start the app, type npm start in terminal, and wait for react app to load
  in localhost:3000

**Don't forget to keep an eye on your API calls, a free account only allows 150
hits, 1 random request (reloading landing page) = 1 hit, searching recipes by
ingredients = 1 hit, each recipe returned is 0.001.**
